Blueprint API:
Blueprints allow you to filter content that comes from the client. This
allows you to allways expect your data in a format you define. For
example, lets say you had a POST route under /signup. Instead of writing
lots of checks to insure that the client has provided the required
information to create an account. Lets say that the /signup route requires
a username and password. Without blueprints you would have to write checks 
to ensure that the client has provided a username and password. That would
look something like this:

from libsodium import Route
def route():
    class signup:
        def onRequest(self, request):
            if request.form.get('username') == None:
                return 'Please provide a username'
            if request.form.get('password') == None:
                return 'Please provide a password'
            create_account(request.form['username'], request.form.get['password'])
            return 'Account Created'
    return Route('POST', '/signup', signup)

With blueprints, all of the checks are automaticly accounted for, before
you even see a request. Using the sodium cli you can create a blueprint like
this:

python3 -m libsodium create blueprint signupBlueprint

It will create a file in the src/blueprints directory, that after editing would
look like this:

from libsodium import Blueprint

signupBlueprint = Blueprint([
('username', str),
('password', str)
])

Now in our updated route:

from libsodium import Route, useBlueprint
from src.blueprints import signupBlueprint
def route():
    @useBlueprint(signupBlueprint)
    class signup:
        def __init__(self, request):
            create_account(request.form['username'], request.form['password'])
    
    return Route('POST', '/signup', signup)

In the sinario above it doesn't save alot of time, but as your requests get
bigger, the benifits of blueprinting become clear.
